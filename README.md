Python Technical Assessment
Overview
This repository contains solutions to five Python programming problems designed to help users practice core Python concepts like file handling, list manipulation, string processing, and dictionary operations. These problems provide a hands-on opportunity to work with Python's built-in libraries and functions, making them ideal for anyone preparing for coding interviews or improving their programming skills.

Problems
Problem 1: File Reading and List Creation
Task: Write a script that reads the file problem1.txt, adds each line to a new list, and prints the list.
Skills Tested: File I/O, list operations.
Problem 2: Count IP Occurrences in a File
Task: Write a script that reads problem2.txt, counts how many times the IP address 192.168.1.1 appears in the file, and prints the result.
Skills Tested: File I/O, string manipulation.
Problem 3: Remove Duplicates from List
Task: Write a function dedupe that takes the list [1, 5, 7, 2, 4, 3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 6] and returns a new list excluding duplicates.
Skills Tested: List manipulation, functions.
Problem 4: Reverse Words in a String
Task: Write a program that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words and prints the string with the words in reverse order.
Example: "My name is Robert" â†’ "Robert is name My"
Skills Tested: String manipulation, user input.
Problem 5: Count Ports in a File
Task: Write a script that reads problem5.txt, counts the occurrences of each port, and stores the results in a dictionary.
Skills Tested: File I/O, dictionary operations.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Basic understanding of Python syntax and common data structures (lists, dictionaries, strings).
